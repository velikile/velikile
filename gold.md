#### Reasonable defaults.
- Linear search through array.
- FIFO managed by integer.
- Store objects by types explicitly.
- Batch processing as a desgin goal since it's the most common case.
- Excplicit latency and throughput constraints. when can I issue the next instruction.
- Version data formats.
- Allocators block ,stack ,scratch.
- Model target manually first visualize the target result somehow.
- Index look aside table.
